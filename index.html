    <h1>Super Smash Bros</h1>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/" title="SSB homepage" target="_blank">Super Smash Bros</a></strong> is a series of 2.5d fighting games consisting of Nintendo characters
        and guest characters from other games. Though you can play it in a similar fashion as
        other fighting games it differs in many ways. While in traditional fighting games your 
        objective is to reduce your opponents health to 0, in Super Smash Bros your goal is to 
        increase your opponents <stong>percentage</stong> which affects how far they are sent flying when they
        are hit by an attack and try to send them past the stage boundry resulting in a kill.
        Players use combinations of attacks to reduce their opponents lives, or <strong>stock</strong> to zero 
        resulting in a win.
